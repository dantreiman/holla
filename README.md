## Requirements

XCode 6.1
iOS 8.0 or higher
CocoaPods

## Building

Install the latest cocoapods.  From the terminal:
    gem install cocoapods

Install dependencies.  Inside the project directory, run:
    pod install

open MoneyClip.xcworkspace

Build and run

Once the app has been launched on the device, the keyboard and actions extension will be available.

## Testing

Requesting and sending bitcoin can be done directly in Messages.app and Mail.app, using copy and paste.

When requesting and sending through the facebook and twitter apps, the text field doesn't support copy and paste so the image must be saved to the camera roll.

### Keyboard

To request money, first enable the keyboard extension using Settings.app:
