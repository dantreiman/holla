Once the app has been launched on the device, the keyboard and actions extension will be available.

## Testing

Requesting and sending bitcoin can be done directly in Messages.app and Mail.app, using copy and paste.

When requesting and sending through the facebook and twitter apps, the text field doesn't support copy and paste so the image must be saved to the camera roll.

### Keyboard
